# Digital Wellbeing & Time Management - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
This is the keystone category. Morning YouTube/Reddit spirals waste up to 2 hours daily before meaningful work starts - potentially 730 hours annually. Mid-day phone scrolling (9gag, YT shorts) drains energy. Porn habit succeeds only 41.7% of tracked days. The pattern: unstructured mornings with no clear first task lead to browsing, which leads to deeper distraction spirals. Fixing this unlocks everything else.

## The Plan
**Environmental changes:** Create separate PC user profile for work/coding with different wallpaper and bookmarks - entertainment sites blocked with no disable option. Phone stays in kitchen after 8PM. Morning Mera Peak training will naturally disrupt the browsing spiral on many days. On non-training days, have a clear first task identified (addressing in evening routine planning). If there's a specific first task, you do it. If there isn't, you drift.

**Behavioral approach:** The gateway is morning browsing before first work session. YouTube/Reddit creates boredom and stimulation-seeking that triggers porn. Break the chain at the start. Twitter is won - no longer tracking it.

## What We're Tracking

1. **Blockers Active (24h)** - Each morning, verify Block Scroll (Android), LeechBlock + NoPorn (PC) were active for last 24 hours. This creates mindfulness and gives chance to turn them back on if disabled.

2. **No Porn** - Continue tracking. Focus on preventing the morning browsing spiral that creates the trigger.

3. **Gaming Under 1 Hour** - Keep tracking. Currently at 74.1% success, maintaining healthy limits.

**Dropped:** No Twitter (battle won at 83.6%)
