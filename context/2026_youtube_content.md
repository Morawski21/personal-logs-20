# YouTube Content Creation - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
Three videos in 2025, down from consistent earlier output. Each video takes 20-30 hours (10h writing, 3h recording, 20h editing). The channel stalled after the bad editor experiment. Procrastination during writing phase extends projects across weeks. Perfectionism adds creative depth but multiplies time investment. With dual employment in 2025, finding motivation and time proved impossible. This is a passion project that provides unique satisfaction and connects you to music - your most consistent hobby. It is part of your identity, and the absence creates stress and self-blame.

## The Plan

**Two-tier content strategy:** Monthly long-form album review (20 minutes, 20-30h production). Additional 1-2 short videos monthly (5 minutes, approximately 5h production each). Short content: single song deep-dives, music news, general thoughts - no full album reviews. This creates sustainable output without abandoning the format that works.

**Writing workflow redesign:** Separate brainstorming from structure. Use freewriting (10-20 minutes timed) to generate ideas without judgment. Create template for methodical review elements (artist biography, previous records, song breakdown, overall themes, rating) with designated slots for creative tangents (Bayesian statistics analogies, music industry commentary, etc.). The creative part often lives in the intro - write the basic structure first, then plug in creative elements where they enhance rather than delay.

**Weekly Starbucks sessions:** Every Saturday 10am-12pm at Starbucks for focused writing. You have done your best writing there. This becomes non-negotiable weekly ritual - the environment change and routine create consistency. Target: complete one script section per session rather than letting projects drift across weeks.

**Lower the 5% threshold:** People publish significantly lower quality content without hesitation. Your perfectionism adds depth but creates unsustainable time investment. Acceptable is better than perfect-but-never-published. The script does not need two weeks - it needs focused sessions followed by execution.

**Editing efficiency:** Create Premiere Pro Motion Graphics Templates for recurring elements. Accept that editing takes time - focus on reducing decision fatigue through templates rather than trying to compress the fundamental work. Self-edit rather than outsourcing until recording consistency is proven.

**Recording:** Not the major bottleneck. Once script is complete, recording follows naturally when you have the house to yourself and good energy.

## What We're Tracking

1. **YouTube Minutes** - Already tracking. Continue logging time on recording, editing, thumbnails, research.

2. **Weekly Writing Session** - Binary check. Did you do Starbucks (or equivalent focused environment) this week for script work?
