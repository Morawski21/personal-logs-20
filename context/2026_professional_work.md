# Professional Output & Deep Work - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
2025 showed strong professional results - dual employment managed, 3 technical books read, Manning Publishing collaboration secured, work-specific deep work grew 4x from January to November. But consistency was the gap. Empty days with light workload turned into drift days. The root cause: morning distraction spirals and lack of structure (addressed in Digital Wellbeing category). Weekend productivity collapsed (Tuesday 2.3h average vs Saturday 0.6h, Sunday 0.9h).

## The Plan
**Primary enablers:** Digital Wellbeing (blockers, separate work PC profile, clear first tasks) and Physical Training (morning structure 3x weekly) handle the foundational issues. Professional work builds on that foundation.

**Daily target:** 2x 1-hour deep work sessions before noon on most days. This is the floor, not the ceiling. Includes any professional work: job tasks, technical reading, courses, Manning writing, personal projects. Work is unpredictable, so this won't happen daily, but should happen most days.

**Professional development:** Systematic upskilling in agentic frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith) through personal project work. Build things you actually use, not just tutorials. Stock market assistant or similar as concrete testing ground.

**Current employment context:** PwC role continuing, likely extending. In talks for potential second position (uncertain). Plan to return to dual employment eventually. Manning Publishing collaboration ongoing.

**What success looks like:** Consistent deep work volume. Job enables house savings with Zosia. Professional development keeps skills current and creates opportunities. Manning work continues as meaningful side project.

## What We're Tracking

**Professional Work Minutes** - Already tracking. Includes all focused professional work: job tasks, technical reading, courses, Manning writing, personal projects. Optimize for consistency, not peak performance.

Target: 120 minutes (2x 1h sessions) most days before noon.
