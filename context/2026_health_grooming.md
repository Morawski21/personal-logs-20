# Health & Grooming - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
You want to feel better in your skin and take better care of yourself. You have the right products and free sauna access 10 minutes away, but showing up consistently has been the struggle. Nail biting and beard plucking create visible damage you want to fix. Taking care of yourself keeps getting deprioritized, and you know you'd feel significantly better if you made it a regular part of your life.

## The Plan

**Hairline maintenance:** Weekly dermapen session, skip topicals 24 hours after. Minoxidil twice daily when possible. Serum on alternating days. Apply hair mask before sauna sessions. Daily finasteride continues as established. Simple routine removes decision fatigue.

**Sauna becomes the anchor:** Target 2x weekly. Free access, 10 minutes away. Turn it into a self-care ritual - hair mask during heat, mango body scrub after first session, face treatments, matching lotion. Make it an experience worth showing up for. Basic routine is 30 minutes, full ritual when you have time is 60 minutes. Leave feeling genuinely refreshed and taken care of.

**Habit breaking:** Bitter nail polish Monday and Thursday mornings. Tweezers hidden. Stress ball at desk. Stop beard plucking through awareness.

**Laser removal:** Once or twice weekly, similar cadence to dermapen. Neck, chest, hands. Eight-week window January through February before Himalayas.
