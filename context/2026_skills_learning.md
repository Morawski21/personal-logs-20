# Skills & Learning - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
Guitar practice (44 hours in 2025) and reading (41 hours) happen sporadically. Anki works well at 72.8% but needs to continue. Nepalski is necessary for Mera Peak in April but started late with only 10% completion in November.

## The Plan

**Guitar:** Continue as casual hobby. CAGED system progression, new songs, maybe additional courses. No pressure for specific achievements - maintain the enjoyment.

**Reading:** Increase volume through casual habit. Grab books more often rather than waiting for dedicated reading time.

**Anki:** Already working at 72.8%. Keep as non-negotiable daily habit.

**Nepalski:** Daily practice until Mera Peak in April. Drop after expedition.

## What We're Tracking

1. **Anki Daily** - Already tracking. Maintain current system.

2. **Nepalski Daily** - Track until Mera Peak (April). Binary completion check.

3. **Guitar Minutes** - Already tracking. Continue logging practice time.

4. **Reading Minutes** - Already tracking. Continue logging reading time.
