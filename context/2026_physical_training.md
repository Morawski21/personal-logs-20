# Physical Foundation & Training - 2026 Plan

## The Problem
You were physically active 32% of days in 2025. The data shows exercise is your keystone habit - movement days predicted success in everything else. You achieved significant goals (muscle-up, Stronglifts, PADI, 27/28 peaks) but lacked consistency. Mera Peak is in April.

## The Plan

**Morning cardio as structure:** Three 1-hour sessions weekly minimum. StairMaster or incline treadmill. Zone 1 and Zone 2 training following Training For New Alpinism - conversational pace, focus on volume not intensity. This replaces morning browsing spiral and creates structured day start.

**Recovery architecture:** Two sauna sessions weekly. Two yoga sessions weekly for mobility and stress management. These are restful activities that can coexist with cardio days.

**Strength maintenance:** Light work during gym sessions - muscle-up skill maintenance, handstand practice, pull-ups. Accessories can also be done as work breaks. The focus remains aerobic base building.

**Diet foundation:** Cronometer tracking returns until Mera Peak. Daily vegetable bowls. This supports training adaptation and reduces junk food pattern.

**Workout quality:** A-F grading from TFNA book. Subjective assessment of each session.

**February/March:** Harder Tatras treks as specific preparation for Mera Peak.

## What We're Tracking

1. **A-F Workout Grading** - TFNA subjective quality for each cardio session.

2. **Yoga This Week** - Target 2x weekly.

3. **Cronometer Daily** - Track until Mera Peak.

4. **Vegetable Bowl Today** - Daily nutrition baseline.
